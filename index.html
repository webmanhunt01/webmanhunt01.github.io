faqs:
- question: What can I use Call Recorder Rec Phone Call for?
  answer: The Call Recorder Rec Phone Call app allows you to record any call you place or receive on your iPhone. Simply download the app, configure it in less than a minute, and you’re ready to record phone calls. After you’ve recorded a call, you can view, playback and share the recording from within the app.
- question: How does call recording work?
  answer: Recording a call using our app is simple and uses the conference calling feature on your iPhone to conference a call you make or receive, and want to record, with our recording call-in number. See the screenshots at the top of this page for detailed instructions on how to record a call you place or receive from your iPhone.
- question: Are there any limits to the recorded calls?
  answer: Nope! You can record as many calls as you want, and each call can be as long as you need.
- question: How do I play and share recordings?
  answer: After you’ve completed your recording and disconnected all calls on your iPhone, the recording will be available within the app, usually within a few seconds (long recordings may take longer to appear). Once visible in the app, you can play the recording in-app
- question: What are the limitations of the free trial?
  answer: There are no limits within the free trial, but it does expire after 7 days. After the free trial has expired, you can still make new call recordings, but you won’t be able to playback any recordings made after the free trial expired, until you subscribe to the paid service. Subscriptions are available within the app.
- question: How much does Call Recorder Rec Phone Call cost?
  answer: The app is free to try for 7 days, without subscribing, and includes all the functionality in the paid version. The free trial has full functionality, and isn’t crippled in any way. Once your free trial has expired, see the pricing within the app for the paid version, which is available in 1 month or 1 year subscriptions, and can be purchased in-app using your iTunes account. The paid version includes all the same functionality as you get during the free trial, and includes unlimited recordings, playbacks, and sharing of recorded messages during your subscription period.
- question: Is there a per-minute or other costs?
  answer: Nope! No per-minute fees and no credits / coin purchases required. Whether you’re using the free trial, or the paid subscription, you can make, playback, and share unlimited recordings.
- question: How long are recordings available?
  answer: The app will automatically download any recording you make to your iPhone, when you open the app. Once on your iPhone, recordings are available permanently until you either delete them or delete the app.
- question: How do I delete a recording?
  answer: You can delete a recording by swiping left on it within the main recordings screen, and then tapping the trash icon
- question: Where are the recording call-in numbers?
  answer: Our recording call-in numbers are located in the United States and Canada. If your cellular service includes unlimited minutes to the United States or Canada, the calls to our recording server are free. If your cellular service charges for calls on a per-minute basis, you’ll be charged at the same rate you are charged for any call to the United States or Canada.
- question: When do paid subscriptions renew?
  answer: Paid subscriptions will automatically renew approximately 24 hours before the end of your subscription period (1 month or 1 year).
- question: I subscribed to the paid version, can I get a refund?
  answer: Once you subscribe to our paid service, your subscription runs until it expires, which depends on whether you selected a monthly or yearly subscription. As we offer a completely free 7 day trial of our app and service, we don’t offer either partial or full refunds for subscriptions.
- question: How do I cancel my paid subscription?
  answer: "You can cancel your paid subscription at anytime prior to it renewing. See Apple’s instructions for canceling a subscription here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039"
